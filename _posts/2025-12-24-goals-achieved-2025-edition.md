## Goals Achieved 2025 - Updated


- [ ] Run 600 miles
    - I hit 406.3 miles. There was a stretch in summer that things just fell off due to travel, visitors, and needing to take care of my family. Last year I hit 500. 
- [x] Optimize retirement accounts for roughly 20-25% of income
    - 25% of income is going to retirement accounts
- [x] Optimize retirement accounts pre and post tax impact
    - I think I am doing all I can do, but I will need look again for 2026. 
- [x] Run a 1/2 marathon length run
    - Achieved on 2025-06-07! Took 2:01:05 and it was lovely. I ran around the Chain of Lakes in Minneapolis. 
- [x] Learn a practical hobby (sewing, woodworking, etc)
    - I started using [LubeLogger](https://joethor.dev/2025/11/07/lost-lube-saga.html) and I replaced the battery in the car myself. 
- [x] Build a bigger community in my neighborhood (hard to prove) 
    - This has been a tough year for some communities. I have tried to donate my time and energy to helping those impacted. Keeping this a bit vague. 
- [x] Read 30 books 
    - [Libby](https://libbyapp.com/) rules! And so does [AudioBookShelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/). 


## Rewards 2025 
I rewarded myself by purchasing some [expensive running headphones](https://shokz.com/pages/openfit2). And I have yet to use them on a run.

I did not do as good of a job of rewarding myself materially, but the family and I took multiple trips that were really restorative and made some great memories. 
## Goals 2026 

Next year, here are the goals I have. Notably, we are expecting our third child early in the year. Last time we had a new addition to the family, I stopped running. So, my running goals have shifted to be more of "maintenance". 

- [ ] Run 400 miles
- [ ] Start lifting some weights 
- [ ] Run 10 miles three times 
- [ ] Be more present for my kids (hard to prove)
- [ ] Continue to allocate 25% to retirement goals 
- [ ] Re-optimize retirement accounts pre and post tax impact
- [ ] Set up a sustainable backup plan because of [what happened this year](https://joethor.dev/2025/10/19/sd-card-died.html)
- [ ] Read 30 books 
- [ ] 12 blog posts 

## Potential Goals 2026

I am currently on the fence about these, but I want to document them for next year.

- [ ] Learn basic conversational Spanish. I would like to have a conversation that goes beyond, "Hi, how are you. It's cold". 
- [ ] Learn a new coding language / framework / library 
    - TypeScript
    - Vue 
- [ ] Use Ruby on Rails to publish an app in Apple App Store or Google Play.

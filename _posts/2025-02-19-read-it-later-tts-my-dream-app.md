## The Problem
I want to read all the amazing articles I find, but do not have the time. 

### Read-It-Later 
I use [Linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding) to manage my bookmarks and by extension, articles I want to read later. I've set up my RSS feed for adding links and also a bookmarklet to quickly add from the browser. 

[Read it later lists are aspirational and fall to the same fallacy as gaming backlogs](https://joethor.dev/2024/12/29/rss-updates.html). It is where I store things I think I'll enjoy if I have the spare time. Spoiler: there is never going to be enough time. 

I am a parent of two young kids and in my 30s, my attention and down time is limited. Especially if I want a clean house, to try to stay healthy, keep my job, and be a passable parent. 

I do not get time to read at the volume I aspire to. 

### Text to Audio 
Most everything I "read" is actually through audio form. I am able to get through 20 to 30 audiobooks a year this way, and I'm a very heavy user of podcasts. 

The [Libby app](https://libbyapp.com/interview/welcome#doYouHaveACard) is amazing for free audiobooks from your local library. 

I am afraid this reliance on audio is making me alliterate. But that is neither here nor there. 

Recently on [Hacker News I saw a post about 11Reader ](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43022398). [11Reader](https://elevenlabs.io/)  uses text-to-speech to read any given url, ebook, or pdf. It has helped me get through a lot of articles since using it last week. 

### My Dream Application
What I want to build: 
- Allow me to flag and article to "turn into audio" in my RSS reader or my instance of Linkding
- The url is sent to a text to speech service API 
- The article is converted into an audio file by LLM 
- Post the audio file to an RSS feed which I can subscribe via my podcatcher
I'm pretty sure all the pieces exist for this workflow. I just want to set aside time to do it.

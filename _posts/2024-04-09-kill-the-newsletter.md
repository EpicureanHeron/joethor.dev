## Problem
A lot of great content requires your email address in order to see it. I do not like having a cluttered email inbox nor do I want to share my info with everyone (if at all possible).

## Solution
[Kill the Newsletter](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/) generates a throwaway email address to subscribe to a newsletter with and generates an Atom RSS feed to add to your RSS reader.
This works with newsletters that also require you to verify your email address. 
Also, this service does not require an account or even your own email address. 

And even better, you can [self-host an instance of Kill the Newsletter](https://github.com/leafac/kill-the-newsletter/blob/main/README.md) if you want even more control.

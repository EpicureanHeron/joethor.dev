title: "Rails 7 and Javascript Presentation"

Back in October of 2021, I became a Ruby on Rails developer without any prior experience in Ruby.

It was an interesting job market and I really love to learn.

My undergraduate degree is in History and Classics. So, I am a bootcamp/self-taught developer. 

One trick I've picked up to overcome the feeling that I am an imposter is to research and present some sliver of the concept that I am trying to work on.

In June of 2022, I gave a presentation about how Rails 7 was changing how it implemented Javascript. I did this via Zoom to the entire IT community at the University of Minnesota. 

[Here are the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HnFL-_caEWJ5Qvf9G_rwgAatZ1omSvzNFNhElnfT3kI/edit#slide=id.p).

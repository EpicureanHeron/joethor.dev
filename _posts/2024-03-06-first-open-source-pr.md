title: "First Open Source PR"

It has been a goal of mine since I learned about open source software to contribute to a project. Especially after graduating from coding bootcamp in 2018. 

I have so many lists of potential PRs and projects and never managed to convert it into action. 

Then, through the course of my job, I found some low hanging fruit and just did it. It took 10 minutes. I forked the repo, created a branch, made my change via the Github web editor, and opened a PR back on the main project.

I fixed a typo on [Thoughtbot's Capybara Accessibility Audit Gem](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara_accessibility_audit).

It is not groundbreaking, but it felt really good to do.

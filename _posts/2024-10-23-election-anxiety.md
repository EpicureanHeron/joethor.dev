I'm very anxious about the upcoming election. I spiraled a bit recently into the "what if Trump wins?". 

So I went ahead and voted early. If you can, you need to vote early too.

That was the best thing for my mental health. 

Now I am not letting myself check polls more than once a day.

I am checking my headlines via RSS every 6 hours (when they refresh).

I do not have push notifications on for anything news related. 

I want this election to be over, but I am terrified of what will happen.

# Practical Communication Advice
## Background
I worked several years on a help desk. I worked with clients to resolve issues in a large financial Oracle database.

My supervisor gave me some of the best communication advice of my career.

The framework below is something I still use every day when working on bugs with clients. Also, when I need to open a ticket to get help from another team, I use this to shape my request. 

## The Framework
Try to answer the following questions when encountering a problem:

- What happened?
- What should have happened?
- Where did it happen?
- What are the steps to replicate the problem?

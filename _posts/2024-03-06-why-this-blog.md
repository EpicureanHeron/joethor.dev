Since having an internet connection, I have used different iterations of social media. Myspace, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc.
The Snowden revelations made me reassess my relationships with these different companies. Fast forward to 2024, free money has disappeared and companies begin to see the content provided by users as potential income sources (especially with the advent of large language models), I thought it would be prudent to own the platform for my thoughts.

Not saying my thoughts are insightful or anything like that. I would like one space to have them which I can find later and also own. 

Additionally, my thoughts are often jumbled and hypocritical. I find writing them out helps spark some cohesion and clarity. 

TL;DR: Skeptical of big companies, desire to own my thoughts, and a place to arrange my thoughts

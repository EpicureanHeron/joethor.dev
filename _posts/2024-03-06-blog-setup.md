# Blog Setup
## Hosting
This site is hosted on Github using Jekyll, following [the very user friendly instructions](https://github.com/skills/github-pages
). 
## Workflow
Literally doing all of this via markdown and within the web GUI on github. To create a post, I just add a file to the project with a `/_posts/YYYY-MM-DD_sometitle.md` and merge it into master. 
I can also use the `_config.yml` to set some additional Jekyll settings.
## DNS
I purchased the domain `joethor.dev` from [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/). They had a [very intuitive guide](https://kb.porkbun.com/article/64-how-to-connect-your-domain-to-github-pages
) to set up the domain with the hosted Github project page.

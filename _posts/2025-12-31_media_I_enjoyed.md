# Media I Enjoyed
Similar to my [Goals Achieved](https://joethor.dev/2025/12/24/goals-achieved-2025-edition.html) post, I want to try to capture media I enjoyed each year. I do not want to use Letterbox (in some small part because I don't really watch movies anymore) or Backloggd. I want to own these lists. 

I realize I did not watch many movies besides what the kids wanted to watch, so I am skipping that category. 

A majority of this media will not be from 2025, but is media I consumed in this year. 

I am writing this New Year's Eve and currently have COVID-19, so the goal is to get this out the door this year. 

I will limit each category to five pieces of media in no particular order. 

I did have a draft which I went into details about *why* I enjoyed each piece of media. I want to do that in the future.

In middle school I got into skateboarding. This was the height of Tony Hawk Pro Skater, X-Games, etc.

Skateboard companies would put out short VHS tapes featuring skaters they sponsored.

I would hit up the local skate shop and spend $15 on whatever brand I was feeling loyal to at the time.

Unbeknownst to me, but these tapes exposed me to some of my favorite bands of all time. The soundtrack on [Flip's "Sorry"](https://www.skateboardmusic.com/sorry.htm) video remains one the greatests.

It includes David Bowie, the Velvet Underground, and the Stooges.

A close second was [Real's "Real to Reel"](https://www.skateboardmusic.com/realtoreel.htm) which got me into Modest Mouse and Gil Scott-Heron.

I saw recently this article on Hacker News: [When Do We Stop Finding New Music? A Statistical Analysis](https://www.statsignificant.com/p/when-do-we-stop-finding-new-music)

According to that, males hit the age of "musical lock in" around the age of 14, which very much tracks with my experience.

I continued to grow my tastes by working at a college radio station for a couple of years where I hosted jazz and classical music shows.

But, those tracks that really hit my nostalgia bone are from the skateboarding years.

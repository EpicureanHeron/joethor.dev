# Wizards
Furthest the shores earths sea 3, they're in the traveler along with sparrow hawk thanks that sparrow hawk is being misery for not wanting to employ magics, and it seems terribly that all wizardry is is not casting spells 

Going postal on the Terry Pratchett book mentions that the best wizards are always not doing magic. 

Wisdom is defined I know I'm not what to do or is it having the power to do great and terrible things and not doing them. Restraint.

Taking the idea to a much more narrow application, writing code is magical. You are able to conjure action in silicon and electrons through words. It can impact the world.

Each line of code should be bespoke and curated.

It should not be done lightly, each method that is out there could do great and terrible things. It could be a bug or cause a senisitve data leak. 

Just because a problem looks like it can be fixed with some sloppy code, does not mean it should, and having the restraint to *not* fix a problem indicates some maturity that is temperered with wizardly wisdom

*IS THIS TRASH?*

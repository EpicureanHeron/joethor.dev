# Gaming Devices 
I like video games. I am also a parent of two young children. Gaming time is fleeting. I have mothballed my gaming PC and have not had a console for years. 

My gaming happens in the between time for just a couple minutes here and there, or potentially after everyone is in bed. 

Gaming for me is 85% actually playing the game and 15% configuring settings or getting *something* to run on *something* else aka a devices "tinkerability"

I was thinking about the dichotomy of devices I own and their purposes for while, and then [this post appeared](https://retrohandhelds.gg/a-year-without-buying-handhelds-how-i-beat-the-sickness/).

I like the categories laid out  
- couch device 
- rucksack device
- pocket device

So, here is a list of my current devices and my notes. 

## Steam Deck
*The Couch Device*
### My Setup
LCD 64 gb with a 512 GB SD card 
### Features
- Suspend a game with a press of a button (huge for parents)
- Plays most games in my Steam library 
- Big physical form factor 
- Battery life varies greatly based on game 

### Tinkerability 
- It is a full Linux computer with a desktop mode, the sky is the limit! 
- [Can emulate other consoles, including the Switch ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/uvlsl9/steam_deck_switch_emulation_my_honest_experiences/)
- Can run [Epic, GOG, and other game stores](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/) as well as Steam 
- [Upgrade SSD](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Steam+Deck+SSD+Replacement/148989)

### Favorite Games
- XCOM 2
- Divinity Original Sin 2
- Yakuza 0
- Vampire Survivor
- Balatro

## 3DS
*The Rucksack Device*
### My Setup  
Refurbished New 2DS XL with various SD cards and a R4 SDHC for DS games
### Features

- 2 screens (whoa!) but the 2DS version has no 3D
- Able to play 3DS and DS games
- [Custom Firmware](https://3ds.hacks.guide/get-started) 
- I missed this generation completely, so almost all new games
- Unique charger (which makes it a pain to travel with at times)
- Clamshell design
	- note: when playing a game from the DS cart, it does not suspend the game

### Tinkerability 

- [Retroarch](https://howtoretro.com/emulation/how-to-set-up-retroarch-for-nintendo-3ds/) can play some games, but struggles with certain GBA games
-  [VC Injecting](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-ultimate-gba-vc-injector-for-3ds.438057/) available to play other games "natively"
- So much custom firmware (CFW) and [custom app store supported by community](https://www.reddit.com/r/3dspiracy/comments/144bzlh/best_homebrew_apps/)
- Hardware: would love to [swap a USB C for the battery](https://consolemods.org/wiki/3DS:2DS_USB-C_Charging_Port_Mod), however the devices are only getting more expensive 

### Games 

- DS
	- Dragon Quest 5
	- Final Fantasy IV
	- Chrono Trigger
	- Pokemon Heartgold
- 3DS
	- Fire Emblem Awakening
 
## Anbernic RG35XX Plus
*The Pocket Device*
### My Setup
RG35XX Plus with two micro SD cards and stock OS
### Features 

- Plays games up to and including some Dreamcast and PSP games
- Retroarch 
- Came preloaded with 1000s of games (which is very suspicious)
- Decent form factor, back buttons are bit "clicky", long play sessions can be tough
- Does not have a proper "suspend" by default, but can be paused

### Tinkerability 

- [Lots of OS to try out with tons of features](https://www.reddit.com/r/RG35XX_Plus/comments/1ax830j/whats_the_current_best_os_to_use/)
- Would like to set up [syncthing to moves save files](https://www.reddit.com/r/RG35XX_Plus/comments/1b1mtbs/syncthing_is_finally_here/) around
- [PortMaster](https://portmaster.games/) can play Stardew Valley and other Steam games 

### Games

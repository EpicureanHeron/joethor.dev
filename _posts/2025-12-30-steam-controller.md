# Steam Controller 

## Steam Hardware Personal History

No, not that Steam Controller https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamcontroller

This Steam Controller (2015) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Controller

I am a sucker bespoke hardware. 

I was pretty excited when Valve was making moves into the hardware space in the mid 2010s. The OG Steam Machines, Steam Link, and Steam Controller.

But I was not excited enough to actually buy of those things when they came out. But the latter two pieces of hardware were eventually discounted heavily and I snagged them.

The Steam Link I used intermittently when I built my gaming pc back in 2015/2016 (pc part picker link) to stream down to the TV. 

I purchased the Steam Link in 2017 for $15.00. Then I purchased the Steam Controller in 2019 for $5 (plus around $10 for shipping). 

I also later became a huge fan of the Steam Deck, but that is chronicled in another post. (LINKS)

## Fast Forward 5 years


My partner and I have been playing some mystery games (see post on media consumption). 

I was shocked when I plugged in my Steam controller to my JSAUX Steam Deck Dock and it just worked! 

Full disclousre, the controller \doesn't feel good. But it works! That is more than I can say for my Xbox controller


## Xbox Hardware Insanity 

Tried to get my Xbox one controller working on my Steam Deck via bluetooth. 

It connects but then disconnects immediately. I searched this issue. 

Needs a firmware update to sync correctly to the steam deck. 

Dusted my gaming pc I built several years and it booted right up! Plugged in the controller. Followed the instructions here: 

Installed the Xbox accessories app. 

Need a freaking windows update. 

To use my controller. 

Oh man.

## Linux vs Windows

Not ground breaking thoughts, but the more I am able to rely upon FOSS projects and hardware, the better. Case in point, the Steam Controller OG vs the XBOX One Controller and a firmware update.

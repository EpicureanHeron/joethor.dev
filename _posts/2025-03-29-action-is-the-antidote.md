# Action is the Antidote to Despair
I heard this quote on the [Make Me Smart](https://www.marketplace.org/shows/make-me-smart/) podcast.

Apparently it is attributed to Joan Baez.

Regardless, I have been struggling with what to do about all the terrible things that have been happening. 

I went through a few versions of this post. I wanted to list out everything that feels like it is attacking our civil rights and the progress that has been made towards justice for all. 

But there is plenty of posturing on the internet. And sometimes screaming into the digital void really is not enough. 

Here are the two things I will do to help with my feelings of helplessness. 

- I am going to start contributing to my local food bank [because it is needed](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-cuts-hit-struggling-food-banks-risking-hunger-low-income-americans-2025-03-25/). 

- I am going to volunteer to help at the [library because they are under attack](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/03/17/trump-cuts-library-funding-institute/82495263007/).

## Why RSS?
I really like RSS (Really Simple Syndication) as a way to manage my information intake.

It is decentralized and personalized. There is no vendor lock in, I can take the list of sites I follow and put them into any RSS app out there.

Here is [quick primer on why to use RSS](https://rss.app/blog/why-use-rss-feeds-fXx54B).

## My Set Up

I currently am self hosting a [docker container with FreshRSS from LinuxServer.io](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-freshrss/?h=freshrss) on a [Raspberry Pi 3B+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/).

I use a [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/) and a domain I purchased to access FreshRSS on the go.

I do not use an app on my phone, I just navigate directly to my instance of FreshRSS via my mobile browser.

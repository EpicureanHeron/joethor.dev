# Accessibility
Iâ€™ve had this draft kicking around for a couple of months and I want to [get it out there per my end of the year philosophy](https://joethor.dev/2024/12/26/Purge-Your-Drafts.html). 
## Why I Do Accessibility Work
 I decided to become an accessibility advocate at work a couple of years ago. It was driven by cynicism and guilt, but I hope it has a positive impact.
 ### Cynicism
I heard of the upcoming impact of the [Department of Justice's rule about Title II and WCAG Standards](https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/). I wanted to position myself as someone who was ready to seize that initiative. I was a new developer hired during the heady days of 2021's tech boom and wanted to ensure my position had some degree of value beyond being an individual contributor.
### Guilt
I am also an able-bodied, white, straight male in America. I've faced very little adversity and I am very privileged.  I want to leverage that privilege to do *something* good.

I have also benefited from [audiobooks, curb cuts, and text to speech](https://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/everyday-innovations/items-invented-people-with-disabilities.htm). I am also constantly frustrated by badly designed websites.

## Ways to Help with Accessibility
Here are some ways I have found to help with accessibility (please to steal them!)
-  I helped organize an Accessibility Day at work to get our portfolio of applications up to WCAG 2.1 standards. This is an ongoing effort as the entire organization is facing a April 2026 deadline.

-  I am part of [Code-People Committee](https://code-people.umn.edu/) where I try to get speakers to share their methods and tooling to the broader community related to accessibility.

-  I contributed to the [Capybara Accessibility Audit](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara_accessibility_audit) gem. [It was a tiny PR](https://joethor.dev/2024/03/06/first-open-source-pr.html).

-  I use best practices whenever I can for accessibility.

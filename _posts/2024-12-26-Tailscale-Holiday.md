I am smitten with [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/). It sets up mesh VPN between devices. It is extremely helpful, as I am traveling this holiday season.

I heard about it on the [self-hosted podcast](https://selfhosted.show/). 

A practical application is setting up a [pi hole for DNS resolution for ad blocking](https://tailscale.com/kb/1114/pi-hole) on the go. Also, you can access all your services outside of your local network.

However, the Android app was terrible.

After a couple of hours using it, my phone battery would be drained and the phone would be hot.

Additionally, the UI was useless. 

The team updated the [Android app in May of 2024](https://tailscale.com/blog/android).

It is now phenomenal. 

Battery usage is minimal and my phone no longer gets hot. But beyond those essential improvements, I can see all the devices on my network, their magic DNS, IPv4 and IPv6. And easily open an exit node, though I have yet to figure out the application of those quite yet.

So kudos to the team. The rework is amazing. It's faster, more stable, and more useful.

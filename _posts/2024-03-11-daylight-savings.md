No one seems to like changing their clocks twice a year. There are documented health issues and overall confusion about why this happens. My biggest complaint with this ritual is that it seems to be kept in place through inertia. 

I believe when the reason to do something boils down to, "it is the way it has always been" then it needs at least to be reassessed.

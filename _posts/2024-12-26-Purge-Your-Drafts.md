You have drafts. I have drafts. We all have drafts.
They aren't perfect.
Publish them and move on. Or delete them. They are taking up too much of your bandwidth.

I wrote this before publishing [my last post](https://joethor.dev/2024/12/26/Tailscale-Holiday.html), which coincidentally I accidentally deleted and had to re-write. That is a knock against [Joplin](https://joethor.dev/2024/03/19/joplin.html) on mobile.

I'm hoping to publish or delete my 2-3 pending drafts. So heads up.

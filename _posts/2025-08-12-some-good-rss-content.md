# Some Good RSS Content 

I am aggregating some content that has come across my feeds regarding RSS in the last two weeks. 

Molly White discussed how to [Curate your own newspaper with RSS](https://www.citationneeded.news/curate-with-rss/) recently. I think of her post as focusing on the *why* to use RSS. Her article focuses on empowering users to break free from algorithmic feeds dictated by big tech companies.

The Syntax Podcast went deeper on how [RSS is Not Dead](https://syntax.fm/show/926/rss-is-not-dead). They focused on *how* to get started and some technical tricks.

# Goals 
## Goals Achieved 2024
This is a list of goals I had in my note taking app that I achieved this year. 

I want to document them.

- [x] Arbitrary amount hit in retirement accounts (mostly dependent upon market forces)
- [x] Get Student Loans Forgiven via PLSF 
- [x] Run 400 miles
- [x] Run 450 miles
- [x] Run 500 miles
- [x] Read 30 books (audiobooks absolutely count)

## Rewards 2024 
I rewarded myself after the 400 mile goal was achieved with a new Patagonia zip up. This was purchased through the [Used Patagonia program](https://wornwear.patagonia.com/).

After 500 miles, I purchased a [walking pad](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081JMW6FJ/) for my standing desk to help cope with the winter. 

I need to reward myself for the financial goals I hit. 

## Goals 2025 

Next year, here are the goals I have

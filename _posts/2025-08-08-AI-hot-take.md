# AI Hot Take

I currently code for a living. I've been asked if I am concerned about AI large language models replacing me. 

The code they write is fine.

But, I am convinced once this round of hype pops and the cash dries up, advertisers will ruin things. They'll be able to pay for weighting of their brands and viola!

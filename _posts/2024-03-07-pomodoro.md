I have worked remotely since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic since March 2020. 
I am incredibly fortunate that I am able to do this, a nice combination of what my jobs have required and a supportive work culture. 

However, it can be a struggle sometimes to focus. One technique that I learned about from a Coursera course is the Pomodoro technique.

Basically, focus for 25 minutes without distraction, then take a 5 minute break. Rinse and repeat. After 3 sessions or so, take a longer break. 

I built a minimal [Javascript version of a Pomodoro timer](https://epicureanheron.github.io/pomodoro/) and deployed it using Github pages around 4 years ago.

It has helped me over the years maintain focus or at least jumpstart my work for the day.

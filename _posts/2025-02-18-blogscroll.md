# BlogScroll

A blogroll is a list of links to other blogs.

At some level, it is the original social media. There is not a central authority massaging the algorithm. It is just a bunch of links hosted on one person's website pointed at other people's sites.

I want to build out a blogroll section of my own on this site. But for now, I wanted to include this project, which is basically a blogroll on steroids.

Also a little self promotion because the project just included my site!

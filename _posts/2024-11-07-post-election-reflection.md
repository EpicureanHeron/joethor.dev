I've listened and read bunch of analysis of what happened in the 2024 election. Honestly, probably too much. 

What happened is a combination of all the factors plus some I cannot even imagine. 

From studying history, people like to make things a simple cause and effect. Events like this are not caused by one factor.

Also from studying history, this is now the Trump era and is probably some inflection point akin to FDR's New Deal. 

What America "is" and what America "means" has shifted. 

And I am coping with my family and my values fit within it.

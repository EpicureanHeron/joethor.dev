# No Algorithmic Feeds

This is not an original idea, it is something that came across some podcasts I listen to and my RSS Feeds.

[The Wavelengths podcast discussed it in the episode with Stephen Hilger](https://pod.link/wavelengths/episode/ZDMxYjZjZjAtMzlmNS00Y2ViLWJmMmEtODQ1NDFkMjM2MWRh). 

Additionally, [The Verge's Installer newsletter issue 105](https://www.theverge.com/tech/816650/ikea-just-took-over-your-smart-home) interviewed Ryder Carrol, who created the [Bullet Journal Method](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/book).

In that newsletter Carrol gives the following advice:

"Delete all algorithmic apps: I could quibble forever with the precise definition here, but I support the theory of getting rid of anything designed to keep your attention as long as possible"

## My Take On Algorithmic Feeds

It is a nice heuristic and a way to simplify my digital life.

Clearly my attention and focus is worth something! Companies have devoted resources in order to grab it and never let go. 

Recently I was really into Youtube Shorts because it kept drip feeding me skateboarding and Hollow Knight Silksong content. 

Looking at my history and the time that I wasted, I disabled that feature (as much as I could, Youtube makes it very difficult to get rid of this completely). 

## Broader Thoughts on Social Media 

I deleted my Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit years ago. I have curated my own feeds and [I have discussed it before](https://joethor.dev/2024/12/31/why-bother-with-rss.html).

I am Discord and Linkedin, the former of which is a real problem some days. On the rare occasion I open Linkedin, the endless scrolling tends to get its hooks into me more than I would like to admit. 

I limit my time on Discord by not having the app installed and using [LeechBlock](https://github.com/proginosko/LeechBlockNG/releases) to limit my time each day. 

That friction is important. 

## Final Thoughts

My attention and focus are finite resources which are valuable. 

Algorithmic feeds are created to dominate those resources for the benefit of the companies which created them. 

I have to imagine at some point, that attention translates into some type of cash flow for the company. 

I want to profit off of my attention, not some giant tech company.
